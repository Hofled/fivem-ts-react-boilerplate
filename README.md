# FiveM React Boilerplate with TypeScript

This is built upon [fivem-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/2277/fivem-react-boilerplate) but with my personal preferences and working with TypeScript.

# Setup
## Cloning the boilerplate
```
git clone https://github.com/Hofled/fivem-ts-react-boilerplate.git resourcename
```

## Dependencies
Navigate into the `nui` folder, where all the source code of the React client-side is in.

Run:
```
npm install
```

## Run a local development server
Initializes a local development server with hot module reloading using webpack.
```
npm start
```

## Build
```
npm run build
```
